# MedicineApp
My first app that im in the works with
Has a database for multiple different types of medications, with many different arguments like dosage timing increment and such.
Includes a form to add a bunch of medications at once that automatically adds it to the database and can send emails or possibly text messages for reminders on when to take medication (Reminder app)
The reminder list holds whatever the user needs reminding of, with the scheduler keeping track of time
That's pretty much it, this is a pretty long program and will definitely take quite a bit of time to fully complete. Last update 9/8/2025
